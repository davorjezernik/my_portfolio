            Hey, I'm Davor. I've always been into tech and software development because 
            I find it exciting how fast everything is evolving. 
            The possibilities we have today and what's coming in the future really inspire me.
            I enjoy thinking up new ideas and turning them into something real that can actually help people. 
            My goal is to build something meaningful that makes a difference in someone's life,
            no matter how big or small.
            Coding keeps me curious and driven. There's always something new to learn,
            a new challenge to figure out, and that's what keeps it fun for me.
        </p>
